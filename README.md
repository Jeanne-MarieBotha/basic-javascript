Variables

- **Create and log a variable**
    - Make a variable called `name` and assign it your name. Print it to the console.
    - Hint: Use `let` or `const`.
- **Change a variableâ€™s value**
    - Make a variable called `age`, set it to a number, then update it to be `age + 1`. Log both values.
    - Hint: Reassignment with `=`.
- **Use template strings**
    - Create two variables: `firstName` and `lastName`. Print a sentence like: `"Hello, my name is John Doe!"`.
    - Hint: Use backticks ``` and `${}`.

Methods

- **String methods**
    - Make a variable `greeting = "hello world"`.
    - Print the greeting in all uppercase, and then replace `"world"` with your name.

    - Hint: `.toFixed()`.

Arrays

- **Create and access an array**
    - Make an array of your three favorite foods. Print the first and last item.
- **Modify an array**
    - Start with `let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]`.
    - Add `"yellow"` to the end, remove the first element, then log the result.
    - Hint: There is a method to add one to the end and remove one from the start
- **Loop through an array**
    - Make an array of five numbers.
    - Use a `for` loop to print them all and a `forEach` to print each number * 2.

Objects

- **Create a simple object**
    - Make an object `person` with properties: `name`, `age`, and `hobby`.
    - Log `"My name is X and I like Y"` using string templates
- **Add a method to an object**
    - Add a method `sayHello` to the `person` object that returns `"Hello, my name is [name]"`.
    - Call the method.
